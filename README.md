# Sprint Tasks

## Setup

### Step 1 - Dependencies

You will need:

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (>= 10.x)

Please install them if you don't have them already.

### Step 2 - Clone the repository:

From the command line, clone the repository using the url provided by Github Classroom.

### Step 3 - Install dependencies

```sh
$ cd PROJECT_DIRECTORY
$ npm install
```

This will install all the dependencies for all the tasks, _it might take a while_.

## Editing and Running the Tasks

The tasks are in the `src/tasks` folder.

Each task has a description, which you can see in the app itself, that describes the goals of the task, and there are `TODO` comments in the source files for each task that indicate where you ought to make changes.

Run the application using `npm start`, and browse to `http://localhost:3000`.  You should see a list of available task sets on the left.  If you click on a task name, you'll see the task "implementation" running on the right.

If the Create-React-App dev server is running, the application page _should_ automatically updated with any edits you make to the task files.  If that doesn't happen, stop the CRA server and re-run it using `npm start`.
